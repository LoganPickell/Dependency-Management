## <p align="center">Purpose of the script</p>

##### The script visualizes population density on an interactive 3D globe. The purpose is to provide an insightful, interactive way to explore global population distribution üåç

---

## <p align="center"> Steps followed</p>

##### 1. Created globe.py (copied from assignment)
##### 2. Create virtual environment to control dependencies
    python -m venv venv
##### 3. Manually install each dependency missing from globe.py
    pip install ...
##### 4. Generated all_requirements.txt
    pip freeze > all_requirements.txt
##### 5. Created and checked dependency_tree.txt
    pipdeptree > dependency_tree.txt
##### 6. Removed all installed packages
    pip uninstill -y -r all_requirements.txt
##### 7. Created a minimal requirements txt file
    pipreqs . --force
##### 8. Reinstalled from requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# <p align="center">Observations or Issues</p>

No issues, I enjoyed the pipreqs . --force option to create a minimal requirements.txt. I plan to start using this, I think it's much cleaner than having 500 dependencies.
